## FAQs ‚ùì

### What is SHA256?
SHA256 is a cryptographic hash function that produces a 256-bit (32-byte) hash value. It is widely used in security applications and protocols, including TLS and SSL, PGP, SSH, and IPsec.

### Why use SHA256_HTML?
This application provides a simple and efficient way to generate SHA256 hashes without needing to install complex software or libraries. It is ideal for developers and users who need quick hashing capabilities.

### Can I use this app for sensitive data?
While the app provides SHA256 hashing, it is essential to remember that hashing is not encryption. Always ensure that sensitive data is handled securely.
